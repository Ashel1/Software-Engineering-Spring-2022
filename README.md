# Software-Engineering-Spring-2022

Goal of the Project: </br>
In the modern world there is a need for a source of information that provides valuable and accurate information about the entertainment industry. Our project idea is the result of the same necessity which incorporates features designed to help enthusiats explore the world of movies and shows with an aim to help users decide what to watch without taking up much of their time. The application will jog the users memory about a movie, show, or person if they have seen it previously by providing a link to the trailer. They will also be able to binge on information about movies and shows that interest them. Our project will feature a roulette that will accept inputs such as the movie genre, the movie rating limit and the streaming platform. This will return a random movie based on the mentioned input parameters, so that the user does not have to spend hours deciding what to watch and rather be able to directly enjoy watching a motion picture or show during their leisure time.
